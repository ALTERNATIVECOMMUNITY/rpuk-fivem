# pma-voice
A voice system designed around the use if FiveM's interal mumble voip server.

# Compatability Notice:

### This script is not compatible with other voice systems (duh), that means if you have vMenus voice chat you will **have** to [disable](https://docs.vespura.com/vmenu/faq/#q-how-do-i-disable-voice-chat) it.
### Please do not override NetworkSetTalkerProximity in any of your other scripts as it can break pma-voice.


### NOTE: If you have any issues please make an [Issue](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice/issues), DO NOT MESSAGE ME FOR SUPPORT.
